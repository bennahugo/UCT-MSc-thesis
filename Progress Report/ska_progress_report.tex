\section{Context}
There is a well-known fourier relationship between the coherence measurements taken with array-based radio telescopes and
the observed sky. Synthesis imaging entails creating an image of the sky through fourier inversion of these 
measurements between antenna pairs. The measurements are usually taken over extended periods of time, during which the 
directions between antennae with respect to a fixed point on the celestial sphere changes due to the rotation of the earth.
In effect multiple coherence measurements of the same source can be made in this way.

The computational complexity of directly inverting this relationship is roughly $\theta(N^4)$ using direct techniques, where
$N$ is the size in pixels of the sky image. To reduce this cost a Fast Fourier Transform may be used as a planar approximation
to the sky. However, this requires resampling the measurements onto a regularly-spaced grid. Furthermore, the planar 
approximation brakes down when imaging wider fields of view. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{FIG_WIDEFIELD_ERROR}.

  \caption[Widefield phase delay]{The combined propagation delay of emission from sources far away from the telescope pointing centre is a combination
  of the error between the planar approximation and the celestial sphere in (a) and the delay difference between pairs of antennae in the telescope
  pointing direction as illustrated in (b). The total phase error is expressed as $w(n-1)$. The multiplicative effect of this w-term becomes a
  significant problem in large non-East-West antenna arrays, where the array components do not remain coplanar as the Earth rotates.}
  \label{FIG_WIDEFIELD_ERROR}
\end{figure}

The signal delay illustrated in figure~\ref{FIG_WIDEFIELD_ERROR} is manifested in the image as an apparent shift 
in source position. As measurements are integrated over hours of observation time this time-dependent shift leads to completely
smeared emission sources in the synthesized image. See figure~\ref{FIG_SMEARING}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/distortions.png}
 \caption[Wide field distortions]{Sources further away from the telescope's pointing centre are smeared out over time, as

 \label{FIG_SMEARING}
\end{figure}

For narrow field images the resampling process only entails a convolution with an anti-aliasing filter that reduces energy of 
sources outside the field of view. This convolutional resampling and fourier inversion process has a cost of 
$\theta(N^2C^2) + \theta(N^2\log{N})$, where C is the support size of the convolution filter and is usually not much more 
than ten pixels per filter dimension.

When dealing with wide field images the cost of the resampling component quickly escalates to dominate the computational
complexity of the inversion process. There are 3 commonly used techniques to reduce the widefield smearing shown above:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Faceting, where a wide field field of view is broken up into smaller narrow field images.
 \item W-projection, where the $w(n-1)$ term is convolved into the FFT relationship between the planar image and the emission sources
 on the celestial sphere.
 \item Snapshot imaging, where short duration images are made, reprojected and integrated into one final image.
\end{enumerate}

Since this costly resampling step will necessarily be called upon multiple times per observation for the purpose of deconvolving the 
effects of incomplete sampling, it is worth investigating how this step may be accelerated. Our work focuses on the convolutional 
resampling component of the first two approaches, a hybrid approach between faceting and W-projection. We focus on parallelizing
this hybrid faceting technique both using CPU multithreading techniques, as well as using General Purpose Graphics 
Processing Units.
\section{Facet imaging (2014)}
When performing facet imaging multiple smaller images of the sky are made. Each smaller image is made with respect to a new reference
centre, by phase shifting each coherence measurement. This effectively means that the resampling step has to be done for each
facet, and the computational complexity of the method grows with number of facets. The filter support region, however remains unchanged.

As Rick Perley \cite{perley1999imaging} points out it is also necessary to make the new facets tangent to the celestial sphere in order 
to keep the phase error over a fixed field of view comparable between facet images. Failure to do so will result in needing many
more facets towards the edge of a wide field image than in the centre. We've implemented this classic faceting approach in 2014 and obtained
good results with both simulated and calibrated data from the Extended Very Large Array. Our imager allows the user to either target the 
regions around a list of coordinates (figure~\ref{FIG_BULLSEYE}) or divide a continuous piece of sky into multiple facets.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/targeted_faceting.png}
 \caption[Targeted faceting]{Here the prototype user interface for targeted faceting is demonstrated. A region towards the edge
 of a simulated grid sky model is faceted. The facet image is displayed in a new window.}
 \label{FIG_BULLSEYE}
\end{figure}

However, this approach poses a cumbersome problem. Since the facets are rotated through a rotation of the sampling coordinates, 
the Point Spread Function \footnote {Fourier transform of the sampling coordinates. Each source will be convolved with this function.
An example is the Gausian-like smearing around each point source in the simulated field in figure~\ref{FIG_SMEARING}. In this instance
the PSF is ideal. With other array configurations the PSF can take on more cumbersome forms} changes per facet. Unlike in normal 
narrow fieldimaging this effectively means that the PSF changes over the final image (each facet will have its own associated PSF). Thus, 
Because of this non-coplanar faceting complicates the task of deconvolution. 

We opted to investigate a coplanar faceting approach instead. With such an approach all the facet images are parallel to 
each other and can be jointly deconvolved. There are multiple ways to achieve coplanar faceting. Non-coplanar facets can be
re-projected and mosaiced onto a common plane using the transformations described by Sault et. al \cite{sault1996approach} in the measurement space 
or using existing mosaicing software, such as Montage \cite{jacob2004montage} in the image space. Doing the latter reprojection and 
background correction during every major deconvolution cycle can prove costly - both in the extra memory required and 
computation time.

Another approach that is more in line with the idea behind w-projection is to introduce an approximation of $w(n-1)$ while resampling.
Here Kogan and Greisen \footnote{AIPS Memo 113 (2009). Available from \url{http://www.aips.nrao.edu/aipsmemo.html}} uses a first order
tailor approximation to the error term, which we incorporated into our imager. A more accurate approach involves including a higher
order approximation to the error term through convolution as with w-projection. This increases the filter support size and the 
computational costs, but using such a hybrid approach it is possible to create larger facet images at the cost of slightly more
expensive gridding.
\section{Hybrid W-faceting (2015)}
In W-projection \cite{cornwell2008noncoplanar} the filtering operation in resampling is changed to include the error term. This filter has to be sampled
at a high enough rate to accomodate the rapidly changing w value at the edge of the image. The filter is precomputed for a
range of values for w between $w_{min}$ and $w_{max}$. While resampling the best-fit filter is picked depending on the
coordinate at which the coherence measurement is taken. See figure~\ref{FIG_W}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.75\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/w100.png}

 \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.75\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/w1000.png}
 \end{subfigure}
 \caption[W as a function of image size]{The W-term varies as a function of image size. Larger images have faster varying
 W-values at the edge of the image. This requires larger filters to accomodate this fast varying function. Non-East-West 
 Arrays with longer baselines have faster varying w values.}
 \label{FIG_W}
\end{figure}

With a hybrid approach \footnote{Suggested by the TDP Calibration group \cite{yashar2009tdp}} the facet images are smaller than those synthesized in a pure 
w-projection approach. The associated filter support regions, as well as number of w-values being computed, are also smaller. This 
makes the gridding operation more data parallel and less memory intensive than full w-projection - the latter requires careful consideration when creating 
images at the Nyquest rate required by the SKA layout (which may be up to $10^{10}$ pixels for the final image according to some estimates). 
Here either a faceting approach such as the one we're investigating may be needed or the gridding operation will have to be done in 
multiple passes.

Another advantage to combining faceting with w-projection is that, for smaller fields of view the filter becomes seperable, requiring far
less memory and precomputation time than its non-seperable counterpart. Additionally this filter is much more likely to fit into the cache memory
of General Purpose Graphics co-processors - this is essential to achieving good throughput on such architectures.
\section{Validation on observed EVLA data}
As part of our validation strategy we've selected a sample EVLA dataset. To ensure the usability of our imager
we support measurements stored in the NRAO Measurement Set format \footnote{NRAO CASA Memo 229. Available from \url{http://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html}}.
The data we've selected as part of our standard set of test datasets is the calibrated and flagged measurement of the supernova
reminant G55.7+3.4 as observed using the EVLA D configuration at L-band. A continuium image is shown in Figure~\ref{FIG_SUPERNOVA}.
